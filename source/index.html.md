# Getting Started

Welcome to Armor Escrow Payments API Documentation.

Armor Payments Escrow as a Service offers the flexibility to support a variety of payment use cases. As a licensed escrow provider through our wholly owned subsidiary, Armor Escrow Inc., Armor Payments takes on the regulatory burden, the money movement complexities, and the dispute management (for relevant order types), allowing our partners to focus on serving their payers and payees. 

See below for the supported use cases and API details.



> To authorize, use this code:

```ruby
require 'kittn'

api = Kittn::APIClient.authorize!('meowmeowmeow')
```

```python
import kittn

api = kittn.authorize('meowmeowmeow')
```

```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "api_endpoint_here"
  -H "Authorization: meowmeowmeow"
```

> Make sure to replace `meowmeowmeow` with your API key.

Kittn uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can register a new Kittn API key at our [developer portal](http://example.com/developers).

Kittn expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: meowmeowmeow`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>meowmeowmeow</code> with your personal API key.
</aside>
